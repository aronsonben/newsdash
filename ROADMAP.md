# Next Ideas to Implement (11/28)
- Make ChatPanel more like ChatGPT instead of multi-turn chat
- Bug where user message in Chatpanel is showing multiple times
- Improve display of news dashboard to make more engaging
- Improve UI overall
- Add some color, icons, images
- Add a little 'how to use' explanation


### Reminders
- This should be useful for other people not just me
- Perplexity is really good at this. I just want to put it all in one place easily. That's the goal.
