# Roadmap (12/23)
- Implement global caching function & display cached data
- Add a little 'how to use' explanation


## Future Ideas
- Send updates as email
- Add ability to temp-edit prompt in-browser
- Perfect the art of displaying information
- Dig into the best sources to use

## Reminders To Self
- This should be useful for other people not just me
- Perplexity is really good at this. I just want to put it all in one place easily. That's the goal.
