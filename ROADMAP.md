# Roadmap (12/9)
- Implement global caching function & display cached data
- Add a little 'how to use' explanation
- [x] Make ChatPanel more like Perplexity instead of multi-turn chat
- [x] Bug where user message in Chatpanel is showing multiple times
- [x] Improve display of news dashboard to make more engaging
- [x] Improve UI overall

## Future Ideas
- Send updates as email
- Perfect the art of displaying information
- Dig into the best sources to use

## Reminders To Self
- This should be useful for other people not just me
- Perplexity is really good at this. I just want to put it all in one place easily. That's the goal.
